# Simple Messenger

The goal of this app is enabling two Android devices to send messages to each other.

# Group Messenger 1

The goal of this app is to send message to multiple AVDs and store them in a permanent keyvalue storage.

# Group Messenger 2

The goal of this app is to add ordering guarantees to the group messenger. The guarantees implemented are total
ordering as well as FIFO ordering. While storing the messages and assigning sequence numbers, the mechanism provides
total and FIFO ordering guarantees.
